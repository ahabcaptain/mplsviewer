This is my first time doing anything like this.. so code needs a bit of clean-up. But it works..

Installation instructions are in the Wiki section.

Note! The 0.5a version is very unstable, it aims to get v6 and v4 address family sorted in viewers.. vrf definitions are parsed in 0.4b already but viewers need updating.
